First of all we need Python, Virtual Environment and Text Editor of you own choice.

###Python 
	For Both Mac and Windows, you can install python through python's global community [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Currently, stable version is 3.10.12. But don't worry about version because we will use Virtual Environment in next section.

###Virtual Environment
	In real world, different user have different version of package install in their machine.Python and django are installed globally on our PC so, it will be pain to install and again reinstall everytime.In this case, Virtaul Environment is our ally.This will help us to create a environment where we can run our project.
